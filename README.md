# COVID-19 ANALYSIS USING SQL AND VISUALIZATION USING POWER BI.

The Covid-19 pandemic caused significant loss of life and negative economic impact, making effective public communication critical for decision-making. Daily updated Covid-19 datasets are available on various websites, including https://bit.ly/3LmfAAG.

In my project, I used the 2022 Covid-19 dataset to explore and visualize data using MSSQL and Power BI. I split the dataset into two forms with Excel for simplicity: CovidDeaths, and CovidVaccinations. The CovidDeaths dataset includes information on cases and deaths, while the CovidVaccinations dataset contains details only on vaccinations and tests.
